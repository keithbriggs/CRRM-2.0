CRRM 5G system-level simulator
------------------------------

Keith Briggs, Ibrahim Nur, Kishan Sthankiya

The CRRM simulator emulates a cellular radio system roughly following 5G concepts and channel models. The intention is to have an easy-to-use and fast system written in pure Python with minimal dependencies. It is especially designed to be suitable for interfacing to AI engines such as ``tensorflow`` or ``pytorch``.  The simulator is based on an earlier one developed for the AIMM project (<https://aimm.celticnext.eu>) by Keith Briggs (<https://keithbriggs.info>).
